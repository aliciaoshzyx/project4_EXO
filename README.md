# project4_EXO

## Description
For this project I intend to make some interactive information page pieces that could be placed in a larger site later on. They will be themed to provide information for a South Korean Music Group called EXO. The landing page will be very simple and have their logo as an SVG where the different letters navigate to the three pages. The first page will provide member information. This will have a theme changer for different musical eras that uses Java Script to switch the images used on the page. The Second page will have information on discography as well as draggable records of music that will play when placed on a record player SVG that animates. The third page will contain information about awards and will have hover and click functions that include various animations in order to show more information.

## What I need to learn and Resources

For this project I will need to learn how to use one or more JS libraries to do interesting animations and manipulat SVGs. I plan to use a JavaScript library for animations that was not learned in class in order to do the animations and SVG manipulation ( likely Anime.js or Bonsai). If my initial choice of JS library doesn't work this may change to a library for animations and a library for SVG manipulation. In order to find fitting libraries I will use resources provided, Google, or ask my professor for ideas. I will also look into the JQueryUI library more for things with the dragging and dropping of the record.
